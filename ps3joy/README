1) If you can connect the joystick and the bluetooth dongle into the same
computer.

Connect the joystick to the computer using a USB cable.

Load the bluetooth dongle's MAC address into the ps3 joystick using:

sudo bash
rosrun ps3joy sixpair

2) If you cannot connect the joystick to the same computer as the dongle.

Find out the bluetooth dongle's MAC address by running (on the computer
that has the bluetooth dongle):

hciconfig

If this does not work, you may need to do
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
and retry
hciconfig

Plug the PS3 joystick into some other computer using a USB cable.

Replace the joystick's mac address in the following command: 
sudo rosrun ps3joy sixpair 01:23:45:67:89:ab

Starting the PS3 joystick
-------------------------

rosrun ps3joy ps3joy.py

This should make a joystick appear at /dev/input/js?

You can check that it is working with
jstest /dev/input/js?
(replace ? with the name of your joystick)
